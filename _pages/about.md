I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Binghamton University in Spring 2025. I research topics in Behavioral Game Theory and in Complex Systems more broadly. Much of my current work is centered on the development and application of simulations to answer a variety of questions related to behavior in strategic environments. I also have experience with in causal inference and machine learning methods. I am currently working as an adjunct professor at Empire State University.
