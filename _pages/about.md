My Ph.D. is in Economics from Binghamton University and will be completed this spring (2025).

I study topics in Game Theory broadly, but my primary focus is developing and exploring applications of computational models with learning, non-trivially interacting agents. Such models can extend both traditional theoretical models and can serve as structural models for direct estimation.
