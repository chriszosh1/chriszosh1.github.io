I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Binghamton University in Spring 2025. I study topics in Behavioral Game Theory and in Complex Systems more broadly. Much of my current work is centered on the development and application of computational models to answer variety of questions related to behavior in strategic environments. I am currently working as an adjunct professor at Empire State University.
