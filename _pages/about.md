I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Binghamton University in 2025. My research applies game theory alongside computational models and tools to study learning and to design solutions to complex optimization problems. I have strong micro-theory foundations and have additional training in applied microeconomics (causal inference) and reduced-form methods. I currently serve as an adjunct professor at Empire State University.
