I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Binghamton University in 2025. My research applies computational economics and game theory, using computational models and tools to study learning and to design solutions to complex optimization problems. I have strong micro-theory foundations and am additionally trained in applied microeconomics (causal inference) and machine learning methods. I currently serve as an adjunct professor at Empire State University.
