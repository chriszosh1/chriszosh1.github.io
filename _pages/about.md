I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Binghamton University in Spring 2025. My research lies at the intersection of Game Theory and Behavioral Economics, with a primary focus on agent-based computational models involving learning and strategic interaction. I am currently employed at Empire State University as an adjunct professor.
